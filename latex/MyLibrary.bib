  abstract = {Alpha male rats from mixed sex colony groups were tested for aggressiveness toward nonaggressive male intruders. Afterward, they were castrated and implanted with testosterone filled Silastic tubes, castrated and implanted with empty tubes, or sham castrated and implanted with empty tubes. There were significant declines in the aggressiveness (lateral attacks, bites, and piloerection but not on-top) of castrated rats without testosterone replacement but not in castrated rats with testosterone replacement. At a second operation, castrated animals had their testosterone capsules removed or had their empty capsules replaced with testosterone filled capsules. When tested for aggression toward nonaggressive intruders, those alpha males which had testosterone removed declined in aggressiveness while those which had it implanted returned to a level of aggressiveness close to that emitted by sham castrated control animals. Subordinate males became dominant when alpha males were castrated and not given testosterone replacement. In a final series of observations, sham castrated males were found to be more aggressive than castrated males when pitted against one another. It is argued that testosterone plays a primary role in intermale social aggression and that the decline in aggressiveness following castration is typically accompanied by a loss of social dominance.},

  abstract = {Impaired social behavior is a common feature of many psychiatric disorders, in particular with substance abuse disorders. Switching the preference of the substance-dependent individual toward social interaction activities remains one of the major challenges in drug dependence therapy. However, social interactions yield to the emergence of social ranking. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that examined how social status can influence the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and how drug-seeking behavior is affected. Generally, social dominance is associated with an increase in dopamine D2/3 receptor binding in the striatum and a reduced behavioral response to drugs of abuse. However, it is not clear whether higher D2 receptor availability is a result of increased D2 receptor density and/or reduced dopamine release in the striatum. Here, we discuss the possibility of a potential shift from down to top rank via manipulation of the mesolimbic system. Identifying the neurobiology underlying a potential rank switch to a resilient phenotype is of particular interest in order to promote a positive coping behavior toward long-term abstinence from drugs of abuse and a protection against relapse to drugs. Such a shift may contribute to a more successful therapeutic approach to cocaine addiction.},

  abstract = {Rats are capable of reaching for food with a single forelimb, but since they locate the target of their reach using olfaction, it is unclear how they adjust their limb movement to compensate for errors. Although it is thought that their reaching movement is ballistic and can only be adjusted by trial and error, whether they can use haptic cues to aid in locating and identifying a target has not been examined. The present study addressed this question by allowing rats to reach through a slot for rigidly held pieces of uncooked pasta of varying thickness, which could be oriented vertically or horizontally from different points around the slot and which were attached to a force transducer. The tasks required that animals not only adjust their reach and grasp to the target's location but also identify the target based on its texture. Acquisition curves were made of head orientation, limb transport trajectories, number of attempts per success, paw orientation, breaking direction and force of the grasp. A haptic discrimination test used pasta and similar sized metal rods with different tactile properties as discriminanda. The results indicated that whereas postural orientation and limb transport trajectory were not modified as a function of target orientation, paw orientation and grasp force did vary as a function of the sensory qualities of the target object, and the rats could make a haptic discriminative choice of a target object. The results show that the rat is capable of adjusting paw movements using haptic information, suggesting that somatosensory features of sensorimotor control of limb and paw movements in carnivores and primates are shared by rodents. This commonality points to a conservation of motor control in mammals, explains some of the idiosyncratic features of rat reaching behavior, and confirms that rodents provide a good model for investigating sensorimotor functions.},

Often, it is most appropriate to conceptualize such groups as dynamic entities, potentially undergoing stochastic structural and/or functional changes over time. For instance, as a student progresses through school, more senior students matriculate while more junior students enroll, administrators and teachers may turn over, and curricular changes may be introduced. What it means to be a student within that school may thus differ from 1 year to the next. This article demonstrates how to use multilevel linear models to recover time-varying group effects when analyzing repeated measures data on individuals nested within groups that evolve over time. Two examples are provided. The 1st example examines school effects on the science achievement trajectories of students, allowing for changes in school effects over time. The 2nd example concerns dynamic family effects on individual trajectories of externalizing behavior and depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Decades of neuroscience research has established the modulating role of stress in cognitive function, such as learning and memory, namely from severe stressors that invoke fear or physical stress. The effect on cognition from other types of stressors, such as stress stemming from social position, has yet to be understood and has received limited attention. Evidence stemming from the graded relationship of socioeconomic status on health outcomes, suggest one’s relative social position may have adverse physiological consequences. Therefore, we used a simple rodent model to examine the relationship between social position on cognitive functions. This thesis aimed to 1) determine whether social hierarchy in rats could be reliably measured using the Tube Test, 2) examine whether social position mediates spatial learning and memory, and 3) assess the role of sex in the relationship between social position, spatial learning, and memory.  Eighty adult, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped, with either 4 males, or 4 females per group (N = 40 / sex). The Tube Test was conducted to determine the social position of groups over 3 days by examining pairwise dominance interactions. Afterwards, Morris Water Maze training was used to assess spatial learning over 4 days, memory through the probe test, and behavioural flexibility over 2 days of reversal training. Subsequently, a one-day Tube Test was conducted to examine the stability of the social positions. Following the completion of behavioral testing, body weight, and stress-sensitive organ weights (adrenal and thymus glands) were measured. The findings of our study provide no evidence that social position affects cognitive function as spatial learning, reversal learning and memory performance was not significantly different across social positions. We found no sex differences in relationship between social position and spatial performance, and our study found no differences in body weight and in stress-sensitive organs (adrenal and thymus glands) across social positions in male and female rats.  In summary, our results suggest no evidence that social position within a group of same-sex housed rats altered learning and memory performance. Furthermore, we did not find sex differences in the relationship between social position and cognition. In our study, animals were not subjected to known socially stressful conditions such as social isolation or overcrowding, and were left alone to examine the social stress from natural occurring social stratification. Further research is needed to confirm our findings and explore when social position becomes a stressor. Furthermore, future directions can aim to explore the neurobiological mechanisms from social stress by comparing corticosterone levels and target proteins (e.g., AMPA receptors) across social positions.},

  abstract = {Background Depression is common and results in a significant morbidity and economic burden. Depression is associated with pervasive impairments in social functioning, and antidepressant treatments are highly variable in improving these impairments. The objectives of this study were to test the effects of depression on social organization and behavior in a rodent model of depression, and to study the effectiveness of antidepressant medication in improving both symptoms of depression and the social function of depressed animals. Methods One hundred-twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and equally divided between the control group and depression group. After induction of depression by 5 weeks of chronic unpredictable stress, rats received either antidepressant treatment or placebo. In parallel with the initiation of drug therapy, 20 social groups of six rats were subjected to the complex diving-for-food situation to evaluate their social functioning. Four behavioral tests evaluated symptoms of depression and anxiety at 3 different time points. Results We found that 1) depressed rats were significantly more active and aggressive in all parameters of social organization test compared with the control and antidepressant treatment groups, 2) depressed rats that received antidepressant treatment exhibited social behaviors like the control group, and 3) depression in the experimental groups was not accompanied by symptoms of anxiety. Conclusions These results suggest that depression can significantly alter the social behavior and hierarchy in the social group in rats. Investigations of complex social group dynamics offer novel opportunities for translational studies of mood and psychiatric disorders.},

Wireless alternatives eliminate constraints associated with optical fibers, but their use of head stages with batteries adds bulk and weight that can affect behaviors, with limited operational lifetimes. The systems introduced here avoid drawbacks of both types of technologies, by combining highly miniaturized electronics and energy harvesters with injectable photometric modules in a class of fully wireless, battery-free photometer that is fully implantable subdermally to allow for the interrogation of neural dynamics in freely behaving subjects, without limitations set by fiber optic tethers or operational lifetimes constrained by traditional power supplies. The unique capabilities of these systems, their compatibility with magnetic resonant imaging and computed tomography and the ability to manufacture them with techniques in widespread use for consumer electronics, suggest a potential for broad adoption in neuroscience research.},

  abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the calcium (Ca2+) hypothesis of brain aging has provided clear evidence that hippocampal neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation is a key biomarker of aging. Age-dependent Ca2+-mediated changes in intrinsic excitability, synaptic plasticity, and activity have helped identify some of the mechanisms engaged in memory and cognitive decline based on work done mostly at the single-cell level and in the slice preparation. Recently, our lab identified age- and Ca2+-related neuronal network dysregulation in the cortex of the anesthetized animal. Still, investigations in the awake animal are needed to test the generalizability of the Ca2+ hypothesis of brain aging. Here, we used in vigilo two-photon imaging in ambulating mice, to image GCaMP8f in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), during ambulation and at rest. We investigated aging- and sex-related changes in neuronal networks in the C56BL/6J mouse. Following imaging, gait behavior was characterized to test for changes in locomotor stability. During ambulation, in both young adult and aged mice, an increase in network connectivity and synchronicity was noted. An age-dependent increase in synchronicity was seen in ambulating aged males only. Additionally, females displayed increases in the number of active neurons, Ca2+ transients, and neuronal activity compared to males, particularly during ambulation. These results suggest S1 Ca2+ dynamics and network synchronicity are likely contributors of locomotor stability. We believe this work raises awareness of age- and sex-dependent alterations in S1 neuronal networks, perhaps underlying the increase in falls with age.},

The exploration focuses on understanding the roles of group size and number within a multi-objective optimization context. The model consists of a colony of memory-enhanced ants (ME-ANTS) which, starting from a given position, must collaboratively discover the optimal path to the exit point within a grid network. The colony can be divided into groups of different sizes and its objectives are maximizing the number of ants that exit the grid while minimizing path costs. Three distinct analyses were conducted: an overall analysis assessing colony performance across different-sized groups, a group analysis examining the performance of each partitioned group, and a pheromone distribution analysis discerning correlations between temporal pheromone distribution and ant navigation. From the results, a dynamic correlation emerged between the degree of colony partitioning and solution quality within the ACO algorithm framework.},

Inductive coupled coils with low dropout regulator design allows true long-term recording without limitation of battery capacity. A 16-channel analog front end chip located on the headstage is designed for high channel account neural signal conditioning with low current consumption and noise. Two types of implantable electrodes including grid electrode and 3D probe array are also presented for brain surface recording and 3D biopotential acquisition in the implanted target volume of tissue. The overall system consumes less than 20 mA with small form factor, 3.9 × 3.9 cm2 mainboard and 1.8 × 3.4 cm2 headstage, is packaged into a backpack for rats. Practical in vivo recordings including auditory response, brain resection tissue and PZT-induced seizures recording demonstrate the correct function of the proposed microsystem. Presented achievements addressed the aforementioned properties by combining MEMS neural sensors, low-power circuit designs and commercial chips into system-level integration.},

To determine if maternal obesity is a detriment to the progress of age-related muscle strength loss in the offspring (F1), we evaluated the indicators of muscle strength, adiposity, and metabolism at young adult and senior adult ages of maternal obesity F1 (MOF1) males and females from a high-fat diet-induced maternal obesity model in rat. Controls were age-matched siblings whose mothers were fed a standard maternal diet (CF1). Combinatorial data analysis was performed with body weight (BW), forelimb grip strength (FGS), FGS adjusted with BW, body fat, adiposity index, and serum triacylglycerols, cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance variables, to identify discriminant traits of variation among F1 groups. During ageing, maternal obesity caused glucose and cholesterol metabolic dysfunctions in male F1, whereas adiposity-associated skeletal strength loss and fatty acid alterations were present in female offspring. In conclusion, offspring programming–ageing effects due to maternal obesity impact metabolism and skeletal muscle strength loss at later ages in a sex-dependent manner.},

Despite similarity in concept, frameworks of human hierarchy have seldom been investigated in parallel with other animals. Moreover, the importance of subordination in hierarchical formation has been largely underestimated in previous research. Here we established, compared, and investigated hierarchy in children and weanling mice. Temperament assessments suggested that children who are less persistent, low emotional intensity, and withdrew easily were more likely to be subordinate in competitive scenarios independent of task characteristics and interaction experiences. The tube test further showed that conflicts between mice were not resolved by winner approach but by loser withdrawal, which was mainly determined by intrinsic subordinate status regardless of opponents. Our study presents evolutionary conserved hierarchical relationships in young and a critical role of the intrinsic subordinate characteristics in hierarchical determination. These findings provide a new perspective on social interactions with potential implications for preschool education.},

Optoelectronic probes (OEPs) are recent upgrades that allow, in parallel, the delivery of local optical stimuli. The procedures to use these delicate electrodes for chronic experiments in mice are still underdeveloped and typically assume one-time uses. Here, we developed a micro-drive, a support for OEPs optical fibers, and a hat enclosure, which fabrications consist in fitting and fastening together plastic parts made with 3D printers. Excluding two parts, all components and electrodes are relatively simple to recover after the experiments, via the loosening of screws. To prevent the plugging of OEPs laser sources from altering the stability of recordings, the OEPs fibers can be transiently anchored to the hat via the tightening of screws. We test the stability of recordings in the mouse hippocampus under three different conditions: acute head-fixed, chronic head-fixed, and chronic freely moving. Drift in spike waveforms is significantly smaller in chronic compared to acute conditions, with the plugging/unplugging of head-stage and fiber connectors not affecting much the recording stability. Overall, these tools generate stable recordings of place cell in chronic conditions, and make the recovery and reuse of electrode packages relatively simple.},

Recent studies have shown that occurrence of sickness behavior is regulated according to a motivational perspective. Thus, the display of sickness behavior may compete with display of other behaviors. In this work, we sought to determine the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration (15μg/mouse i.p.) in the social behavior of dominant and submissive mice. Results showed that social hierarchy influences the expression of sickness behavior. While dominant mice treated with LPS showed an expected reduction in total frequency of behaviors displayed, such decrease did not happen following the same treatment to submissive mice. Similar results occurred regarding social and aggressive behavior. The use of a motivational perspective provides the assumption that, due to their high social ranking, dominant mice were able to prioritize recuperative behavior. Submissive mice, on the other hand, even though treated with LPS, seemed to essentially focus on social defensive behaviors since they remained in the presence of the dominant individuals. Effects of sickness on the hierarchical organization of mice remain to be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Social behaviors such as cooperation are crucial for mammals. A deeper knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms underlying cooperation can be beneficial for people suffering from pathologies with impaired social behavior. Our aim was to study the brain activity when two animals synchronize their behavior to obtain a mutual reinforcement. In a previous work, we showed that the activity of the prelimbic cortex (PrL) was enhanced during cooperation in rats, especially in the ones leading most cooperative trials (leader rats). In this study, we investigated the specific cell type/s in the PrL contributing to cooperative behaviors. To this end, we collected rats’ brains at key moments of the learning process to analyze the levels of c-FOS expression in the main cellular groups of the PrL (glutamatergic cells containing D1 and D2 receptors and interneurons). Leader rats showed increased c-FOS activity in cells expressing D1 receptors during cooperation. In addition, we analyzed the levels of anxiety, dominance, and locomotor behavior, finding that leader rats are in general less anxious and less dominant than followers. We also recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the PrL, the nucleus accumbens septi (NAc), and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Spectral analysis showed that delta activity in PrL and NAc increased when rats cooperated, while BLA activity in delta and theta bands decreased considerably during cooperation. The PrL and NAc also increased their connectivity in the high theta band during cooperation. Thus, the present work identifies the specific PrL cell types engaged in this behavior, as well as its connectivity with subcortical brain regions (BLA, NAc) during cooperation. Significance Statement Brain mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviors remain unknown. The present study identified specific neuronal types from the PrL cortex engaged in the acquisition of a cooperative task, as well as their connectivity with subcortical projection sites, such as the NAc and the BLA during cooperation. Rats leading the cooperation trials (designated leaders) presented an increased activation of D1-containing neurons in the PrL during cooperation. The PrL and NAc electrical activity increased when rats were cooperating, while the BLA activity increased before cooperation. The PrL and NAc showed increased functional connectivity at the moment of cooperation on the platform, whereas during the individual phase the highest connectivity was found before the animals climbed individually onto the platform.},

  abstract = {A large portion of basic biomedical research studies are conducted using genetically defined, inbred mouse strains. The C57BL/6 mouse strain is the most widely used genetic background in current rodent research. The rationale for using inbred strains is that all individuals are genetically identical with minimal phenotypic variation, allowing for more statistically powerful analyses. F1 hybrids between two inbred strains are also genetically identical to one another but are heterozygous at every locus at which the parental strains differ rather than homozygous. Both theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that this heterozygosity in F1 hybrids allow for potentially greater resilience in response to the inevitable stresses of laboratory environments. The purpose of this study was to characterize the differences in commonly used tests of physical performance (forelimb grip strength and rotarod) and anxiety-like behavior between the F1 hybrids created from BALB/c females mated to C57BL/6 males (called CB6F1 mice) and one of its parental strains, C57BL/6. We used a natural cross-fostering breeding scheme to minimize maternal care effects and emphasize the effects of genetic differences. We found significant correlations between anxiety-like behavioral measures and physical performance measures which are not traditionally associated with anxiety-like behavior, and which differ between strains. Findings from this study should be taken into consideration when designing behavioral studies and choosing model organisms.},

The second aspect which this book illustrates is that of following a procedure of inquiry which is well known but seldom used in the social sciences. The problem of aggressive behavior is here advanced one step along this road which all social inquiry that aspires to become truly scientific must eventually follow. This step has consisted partly in a more systematic formulation and further elaboration of the Frustration-Aggression hypothesis which had already been stated by Freud and others, and partly in bringing together a larger body of relevant illustrative material. It is therefore in the nature of a second approximation looking toward a scientific theory of aggressive behavior. It is published in its present tentative form in the hope that it will stimulate further inquiry not only at the Institute but elsewhere.

Neuroscientists have adopted several model organisms to study dominance hierarchies in the laboratory setting, including fish, reptiles, rodents and primates. We review recent literature across species that sheds light onto how the brain represents social rank to guide socially appropriate behaviour within a dominance hierarchy. First, we discuss how the brain responds to social status signals. Then, we discuss social approach and avoidance learning mechanisms that we propose could drive rank-appropriate behaviour. Lastly, we discuss how the brain represents memories of individuals (social memory) and how this may support the maintenance of unique individual relationships within a social group.

Available evidence suggests the prefrontal cortex is a keystone in this circuit, but upstream and downstream candidates are progressively emerging. In this review, we compare and integrate findings from rodent and primate studies to create a model of the neural and cellular networks supporting social hierarchies, both from a macro (i.e., circuits) to a micro-scale perspective (microcircuits and synapses). We start by summarizing the literature on the prefrontal cortex and other relevant brain regions to expand the current “prefrontal-centric” view of social hierarchy behaviors. Based on connectivity data we also discuss candidate regions that might inspire further investigation, as well as the caveats and strategies that have been used to further our understanding of the biological substrates underpinning social hierarchy and dominance.},

  abstract = {Social hierarchies are a prevalent feature of all animal groups, and an individual's rank within the group can significantly affect their overall health, typically at the greatest expense of the lowest-ranked individuals, or omegas. These subjects have been shown to exhibit various stress-related phenotypes, such as increased hypothalamic-pituitary axis activity and increased amygdalar corticotropin-releasing factor levels compared to higher-ranked subjects. However, these findings have been primarily characterized in males and in models requiring exhibition of severe aggression. The goals of the current study, therefore, were to characterize the formation and maintenance of social hierarchies using the tube test and palatable liquid competition in same-sex groups of male and female C57BL/6~J mice. We also aimed to examine the effects of tube test-determined social rank on plasma and hypothalamic oxytocin and vasopressin levels, peptides with established roles in social behaviors and the stress response. Lastly, we assessed the effects of environmental enrichment and length of testing on the measures outlined above. Overall, we demonstrated that males and females develop social hierarchies and that these hierarchies can be determined using the tube test. While we were unable to establish a consistent connection between peptide levels and social rank, we observed transient changes in these peptides reflecting complex interactions between social rank, sex, environment, and length of testing. We also found that many male and female omegas began to exhibit passive coping behavior after repeated tube test losses, demonstrating the potential of this assay to serve as a model of chronic, mild psychosocial stress.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary processes can interact with the mechanisms of steroid hormone action to drive interspecific variation in behavioural output, yet the exact nature of these interactions is poorly understood. To investigate this issue, we compare the endocrine machinery underlying the winner effect (an ability to increase winning behaviour in response to past victories) in two closely related species of Peromyscus mice. Typically, after winning a fight, California mice (Peromyscus californicus) experience a testosterone (T) surge that helps enhance their future winning behaviour, whereas white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) experience neither a T surge nor a change in subsequent winning behaviour. However, our results indicate that when the post-victory T response of male white-footed mice is phenotypically engineered to resemble that of California mice, individuals are capable of developing a strong and lasting winner effect. Moreover, this ‘induced’ winner effect in white-footed mice qualitatively matches the winner effect that develops naturally in California mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that white-footed mice have the physiological machinery necessary to form a robust winner effect comparable to that formed by California mice, but are unable to endogenously activate this machinery after achieving winning experiences. We speculate that evolutionary processes, like selection, operate on the physiological substrates that govern post-victory T release to guide divergence in the winner effect between these two species.},

  abstract = {The consistent relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health has been widely covered in the media and scientific journals, which typically argue that physical-health inequalities are caused by material disadvantage directly or indirectly (e.g., chronic environmental-stress, health care resources, etc.). Such explanations do not explain the finely stratified health differences across the entire range of SES. Recent theories have helped address such limitations, but implicate multiple different explanatory pathways. For example, differential epidemiology articles have argued that individual differences are the “fundamental cause” of the gradient (Gottfredson, 2004). Alternatively, variants of allostatic load theory (McEwen \& Stellar, 1993), such as the Risky Families model (Repetti, Taylor, \& Seeman, 2002) implicate the early home-environment. These theory-driven pathways align with interpretations associated with biometrical models; yet, little research has applied biometrical modeling to understanding the sources of the gradient. Our study presents several innovations and new research findings. First, we use kinship information from a large national family dataset, the NLSY79, whose respondents are approximately representative of United States adolescents in 1979. Second, we present the first biometrical analysis of the relationships between SES and health that uses an overall SES measure. Third, we separate physical and mental health, using excellent measurement of each construct. Fourth, we use a bivariate biometrical model to study overlap between health and SES. Results suggest divergent findings for physical and mental health. Biometrical models indicate a primarily genetic etiology for the link between SES and physical health, and a primarily environmental etiology for the link between SES and mental health.

In animal models, prolonged social stress has proven to be useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying affective-like disorders. When considering experimental approaches for studying depression, social defeat stress, in particular, has been shown to have excellent etiological, predictive, discriminative and face validity. Described here is a protocol whereby C57BL/6J mice that are repeatedly subjected to bouts of social defeat by a larger and aggressive CD-1 mouse results in the development of a clear depressive-like syndrome, characterized by enduring deficits in social interactions. Specifically, the protocol consists of three important stages, beginning with the selection of aggressive CD-1 mice, followed by agonistic social confrontations between the CD-1 and C57BL/6J mice, and concluding with the confirmation of social avoidance in subordinate C57BL/6J mice. The automated detection of social avoidance allows a marked increase in throughput, reproducibility and quantitative analysis. This protocol is highly adaptable, but in its most common form it requires 3–4 weeks for completion.},

Cannon in his “The wisdom of the body” (1932) systematically used the engineering vision of regulation. In 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This term causes much debate when one takes it literally, as a physical quantity, i.e. a sort of energy. Selye did not use the language of mathematics systematically, but the formalization of his phenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to verifiable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in systems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and the universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors was discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious symptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and volatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many observations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial time series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new experiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of depression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were developed: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several families of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the first group of models was based on Selye's concept of adaptation energy and used fitness estimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor bifurcation and on the advection–diffusion model for distribution of population in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of models and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention to the results of the last ten years and open questions.},

Social hierarchies that include dominant-submissive relationships are common in both animal and human societies. These relationships can be affected by interactions with others and with their environment, making them difficult to analyze in a controlled study. Rather than a simple dominance hierarchy, this formation has a complicated presentation that allows rats to avoid aggression. Status can be stagnant or mutable, and results in complex societal stratifications. Here we describe a complex diving-for-food task to investigate rodent social hierarchy and behavioral interactions. This animal model may allow us to assess the relationship between a wide range of mental illnesses and social organization, as well as to study the effectiveness of therapy on social dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Objectives Social animals often have dominance hierarchies, with high rank conferring preferential access to resources. In primates, competition among males is often assumed to occur predominantly over reproductive opportunities. However, competition for food may occur during food shortages, such as in temperate species during winter. Higher-ranked males may thus gain preferential access to high-profitability food, which would enable them to spend longer engaged in activities other than feeding. Materials and methods We performed a field experiment with a breeding band of golden snub-nosed monkeys, a species that lives in a multi-level society in high-altitude forests in central China. We provisioned monkey's high-profitability food during winter when natural foods are limited, and then recorded the times individual adult males spent engaged in different behaviors. Results Higher-ranking males spent less time feeding overall and fed on provisioned foods at a higher rate than lower-ranking males. Higher-ranking males therefore had more time to spend on alternative behaviors. We found no significant difference according to rank in times spent moving or resting. However, high-ranking males spend significantly longer on affiliative behaviors with other members of their social sub-units, especially grooming and being groomed, behaviors known to promote social cohesion in primates. Discussion We show that preferential access to high-profitability foods likely relaxes time-budget constraints to higher-ranking males. High-ranking males thus spend more time on non-feeding activities, especially grooming, which may enhance social cohesion within their social sub-unit. We discuss the potential direct and indirect benefits to high-ranking males associated with preferential access to high-value food during winter.},

The present paper reviews the current literature on the interaction between testosterone (T), cortisol (C) and status in humans, with reference to non-human animal research. We discuss the complexity of the social neuroendocrinology of status with a focus on stable status, competitions for status, and the effects of severe social subjugation. Importantly, we conclude that the relationship between these hormones and status is not direct. We address moderators of the relationship between hormones and status, such as sex, individual differences, context, and T x C interactions, to get a more nuanced understanding of this relationship. Future directions include suggestions for examining this relationship longitudinally, including more females in status research, additional focus on social context and hormonal interactions, as well as non-competitive routes to status.},

Behavioral functional assessments such as volitional grip strength testing (vGST) are limited by inherent behavioral variability. Isometric tetanic force testing (ITFT) is highly reliable but precludes serial measurements. Combining elements of vGST and ITFT, stimulated grip strength testing (sGST) involves percutaneous median nerve stimulation to elicit maximal tetanic contraction of digital flexors, thereby allowing for consistent measurement of maximal grip strength. Methods We measured side-to-side equivalence of force using sGST, vGST, and ITFT to determine relative reliability and repeatability. We also performed weekly force measurements following median nerve repair. Results sGST demonstrated greater reliability and inter-trial repeatability than vGST and similar reliability to ITFT, with the added benefit of serial measurements. Conclusions sGST is a valid method for assessing functional recovery that addresses the limitations of the currently available modalities used in translational peripheral nerve regeneration research.},

  abstract = {Although high levels of anxiety might be expected to negatively influence learning and memory, it remains to be shown whether individual differences in anxiety may influence spatial learning and memory in outbred rat populations. We have studied this possibility in male Wistar rats whose levels of anxiety were first characterized as either high (HA) or low (LA) according to their behavior in the elevated plus maze or in the open field test. Subsequently, their performance in the Morris water maze was studied, a task dependent on hippocampal activity. Interestingly, LA rats showed a faster acquisition and better memory in the water maze when compared to HA rats. Indeed, this difference in performance could mainly be attributed to the increase in thigmotactic behavior (swimming in circles close to the maze walls) displayed by HA rats during spatial navigation. Glucocorticoids are known to affect the state of anxiety and the hippocampus is the main target of glucocorticoids in the brain. Hence, we investigated whether the hippocampal expression of the two classical corticosteroid receptors, mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) differed in the two groups of rats. We found that LA rats displayed higher hippocampal expression of MR but not GR than HA rats. Indeed, the expression levels for these receptors were positively correlated with the amount of time spent by the animals in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Moreover, we present evidence that the levels of anxiety quantified in the first stages of our study constitute a trait rather than a state. Taken together, this study has generated evidence of a close interaction between the anxiety trait, hippocampal MR expression and the learning abilities of individuals in stressful spatial orientation tasks.},

We designed and implemented a novel device that allows Neuropixels probes to be customized for chronically implanted experiments in freely moving mice. We demonstrate the ease and utility of this approach in recording hundreds of neurons during an ethological behavior across weeks of experiments. We provide the technical drawings and procedures for other researchers to do the same.

  abstract = {Dystonias are a heterogenous group of often disabling movement disorders characterized by uncontrollable simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. Secondary dystonias are often caused by injuries to the central nervous system such as stroke, trauma, or Parkinson Disease. Primary dystonia, on the other hand, presents idiopathically without clear structural lesions or other neurological symptoms. Symptoms may be present in one body region, as in focal dystonia, or include large regions of the body, as in generalized dystonia. Existing therapies for dystonia are limited and often cause undesirable side effects or require surgery.  	A significant barrier to improving therapies for dystonia is a lack of understanding of its pathophysiology. Both genetic and extragenetic factors are believed to contribute, as evidenced by endophenotypes in both symptomatic and non-symptomatic carriers of dystonia-causing genes. These endophenotypes include loss of intracortical inhibition, maladaptive plasticity, and abnormal sensorimotor integration. However, most mouse behavioral assays are implemented independently of cortex. It is therefore important to identify dystonia mouse models in which motor cortex-dependent behaviors are altered in ways relevant to human disease. 	I implemented several behavioral paradigms with the goal of characterizing cortically-dependent behaviors in the recently developed Dlx-CKO mouse model of dystonia. I found that Dlx-CKO mice develop abnormal movements during a manual skilled reaching task and that   these abnormal movements respond to antimuscarinics, which are used to treat human dystonia. Additional testing on an automated skilled reaching task failed to replicate these results, suggesting that task demands may influence development of abnormal movements. Automated skilled reaching also revealed that Dlx-CKO mice exhibit a primary motor deficit. This finding is supported by results in a pasta handling task showing that Dlx-CKO mice exhibit more frequent pasta drops. Lastly, grooming was used to assess innate motor sequence performance independently of cortex. Dlx-CKO mice exhibited normal syntactic chain sequences, but reduced chain initiation. This result parallels abnormalities in motor sequencing identified in genetic carriers of DYT1. 	This work establishes cortically-dependent motor abnormalities in a genetic mouse model of dystonia. These results support the use of a wider variety of behavioral assays to characterize dystonia models. The motor abnormalities identified in this work may facilitate determination of the interplay between genetic and extragenetic factors in the development of dystonia, and allow identification of physiologic changes that lead directly to impaired motor function.},

  abstract = {Advances in behavioral optogenetics are limited by the absence of high-throughput pipelines for the automated analysis of behavior in freely behaving animals. Although a variety of AI algorithms has been proposed that enable automation of behavioral analysis, existing methods are generally low-throughput. In addition, optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits typically requires physical tethers to light sources, which limits the number of brain areas that can be targeted and thus constrains behavioral testing. Here, we develop a new wireless platform that combines a battery-free dual-channel optogenetic implant with an AI algorithm for highthroughput behavioral analysis. In our platform, a customized AI algorithm detected and quantified freezing behavior of rats that had undergone fear conditioning. Notably, our platform allows up to four enclosures to be monitored simultaneously. Wireless dual-channel optogenetic devices were implanted in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to permit independent modulation of BLA principal neurons (red light, AAV-CaMKII-JAWS) or BLA interneurons (blue light, AAVmDlx-ChR2) in freely behaving animals. In vivo validation with behaving rats demonstrates the utility of the telemetry system for large-scale optogenetic studies.},

  abstract = {Social rank functions to facilitate coping responses to socially stressful situations and conditions. The evolution of social status appears to be inseparably connected to the evolution of stress. Stress, aggression, reward, and decision-making neurocircuitries overlap and interact to produce status-linked relationships, which are common among both male and female populations. Behavioral consequences stemming from social status and rank relationships are molded by aggressive interactions, which are inherently stressful. It seems likely that the balance of regulatory elements in pro- and anti-stress neurocircuitries results in rapid but brief stress responses that are advantageous to social dominance. These systems further produce, in coordination with reward and aggression circuitries, rapid adaptive responding during opportunities that arise to acquire food, mates, perch sites, territorial space, shelter and other resources. Rapid acquisition of resources and aggressive postures produces dominant individuals, who temporarily have distinct fitness advantages. For these reasons also, change in social status can occur rapidly. Social subordination results in slower and more chronic neural and endocrine reactions, a suite of unique defensive behaviors, and an increased propensity for anxious and depressive behavior and affect. These two behavioral phenotypes are but distinct ends of a spectrum, however, they may give us insights into the troubling mechanisms underlying the myriad of stress-related disorders to which they appear to be evolutionarily linked.},

  abstract = {Bite force is an ecologically relevant performance trait that has been measured to better understand the adaptations to diet and habitat use. Moreover, bite force is relevant in understanding reproductive success, as well as inter- and intraspecific competition. African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia) are a unique clade of mammals that use different digging strategies, show different types of social organization and occur in ecologically diverse savanna habitats in sub-Saharan Africa. Whereas previous studies have suggested these animals have exceptionally high bite forces, the ecological and other proximate and ultimate drivers of variation in bite force in the group remain unstudied. In the present study we measured in vivo bite force of 394 adult specimens from 10 African mole-rat species including all genera within the family. Our results show that in African mole-rats digging mode is a major driver of variation in bite force, with chisel-tooth diggers being stronger biters than scratch diggers. Moreover, species living in habitats characterized by low and irregular precipitation patterns and in soils with a high content of coarse particles have a higher bite force than species occupying habitats with a regular rainfall pattern and fine soil types. This suggests that bite force in bathyergids has evolved in concert with rainfall and soil characteristics of different savanna habitats, which have contributed to the successful radiation of these subterranean mammals across sub-Saharan Africa.

Mice with top and bottom social ranks are subjected to a three-chamber social interaction test to measure social motivation. The top ranked mice spend more time interacting with a stranger mouse than the bottom ranked mice, suggesting that social dominance may positively influence social motivation. When subjected to a novel environment, mice with different social ranks show similar locomotion and exploring activity in the open field test, suggesting no detectable difference in certain aspects of non-social motivation.

Yet this explanation has difficulty accounting for the often-observed main effects between support and mental health. Relational regulation theory (RRT) hypothesizes that main effects occur when people regulate their affect, thought, and action through ordinary yet affectively consequential conversations and shared activities, rather than through conversations about how to cope with stress. This regulation is primarily relational in that the types of people and social interactions that regulate recipients are mostly a matter of personal taste. RRT operationally defines relationships quantitatively, permitting the clean distinction between relationships and recipient personality. RRT makes a number of new predictions about social support, including new approaches to intervention.},

Predisposition to stress susceptibility is believed to be influenced by genetic factors and early adversity. However, beyond genetics and life experiences, recent evidence has highlighted social rank as a key determinant of susceptibility to stress, underscoring dominant individuals as the vulnerable ones. This evidence is in conflict with epidemiological, clinical, and animal work pointing at a link between social subordination and depression. Here, we review and analyze rodent protocols addressing the relevance of social rank to predict vulnerability to chronic social stress. We also discuss whether a specific social status (i.e., dominance or subordination) is the appropriate predictor of vulnerability to develop stress-induced depression or rather, the loss of social rank and resources.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked inherited disease due to dystrophin deficiency causing skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction. Affected patients lose ambulation by age 12 and usually die in the second to third decades of life from cardiac and respiratory failure. Symptomatic treatment includes the use of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, which are associated with side effects including weight gain, osteoporosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Novel treatment options include blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, because angiotensin as well as aldosterone contribute to persistent inflammation and fibrosis, and aldosterone blockade represents an efficacious anti-fibrotic approach in cardiac failure. Recent preclinical findings enabled successful clinical testing of a combination of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in DMD boys. The efficacy of MRAs alone on dystrophic skeletal muscle and heart has not been investigated. Here, we tested efficacy of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone as a monotherapy in a preclinical DMD model. METHODS AND RESULTS: The dystrophin-deficient, utrophin haploinsufficient mouse model of DMD was treated with finerenone and compared with untreated dystrophic and wild-type controls. Grip strength, electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, muscle force measurements, histological quantification, and gene expression studies were performed. Finerenone treatment alone resulted in significant improvements in clinically relevant functional parameters in both skeletal muscle and heart. Normalized grip strength in rested dystrophic mice treated with finerenone (40.3~±~1.0~mN/g) was significantly higher (P~=~0.0182) compared with untreated dystrophic mice (35.2~±~1.5~mN/g). Fatigued finerenone-treated dystrophic mice showed an even greater relative improvement (P~=~0.0003) in normalized grip strength (37.5~±~1.1~mN/g) compared with untreated mice (29.7~±~1.1~mN/g). Finerenone treatment also led to significantly lower (P~=~0.0075) susceptibility to limb muscle damage characteristic of DMD measured during a contraction-induced injury protocol. Normalized limb muscle force after five lengthening contractions resulted in retention of 71~±~7\% of baseline force in finerenone-treated compared with only 51~±~4\% in untreated dystrophic mice. Finerenone treatment also prevented significant reductions in myocardial strain rate (P~=~0.0409), the earliest sign of DMD cardiomyopathy. Moreover, treatment with finerenone led to very specific cardiac gene expression changes in clock genes that might modify cardiac pathophysiology in this DMD model. CONCLUSIONS: Finerenone administered as a monotherapy is disease modifying for both skeletal muscle and heart in a preclinical DMD model. These findings support further evaluation of finerenone in DMD clinical trials.},

Differences in dopamine levels have been found between dominant and submissive animals. However, it is still unclear whether these differences arise as a consequence of the rewarding nature of the acquisition of a dominant rank, or whether they preexist and favor dominance by promoting reward-seeking behavior. Given that acquisition of a social rank determines animals’ priority access to resources, we hypothesized that reward-seeking behavior might affect hierarchy establishment, and that modulation of the dopaminergic system could affect the outcome of social competition. We characterized reward-seeking behaviors based on rats’ latency to get a palatable-reward when given temporary access to it. Subsequently, rats exhibiting short (SL) and long (LL) latency to get the rewards cohabitated for more than two weeks, in order to establish a stable hierarchy. We found that SL animals exhibited dominant behavior consistently in social competition tests (for palatable-rewards and two water competition tests) after hierarchy was established, indicating that individual latency to rewards predicted dominance. Moreover, because SL animals showed higher mesolimbic levels of dopamine than LL rats, we tested whether stimulation of mesolimbic dopamine neurons could affect the outcome of a social competition. Indeed, a combination of optical stimulation of mesolimbic dopamine neurons during individual training and during a social competition test for palatable rewards resulted in improved performance on this test.},

We found that hundreds of units could be recorded for multiple months, but that yields depended systematically on anatomical position. Explanted probes displayed a small increase in noise compared to unimplanted probes, but this was insufficient to impair future single-unit recordings. We conclude that cost-effective, multi-region, and multi-probe Neuropixels recordings can be carried out with high yields over multiple months in rats or other similarly sized animals.

Along with reported benefits for consumer and PSW involvement in care revealed by mixed method studies, destigmatization at the personal and system level is a crucial PSW component.           Summary~           Various types of peer support merit further evaluation. Assessing the impact of peer support on service users, peer providers and organizations require complex intervention studies, using mixed methods designs with qualitative exploration of underlying processes and experiences to complement high-quality controlled trials.},

  abstract = {Animals often are prosocial, displaying behaviors that result in a benefit to one another [1–15] even in the absence of self-benefit [16–21] (but see [22–25]). Several factors have been proposed to modulate these behaviors, namely familiarity [6, 13, 18, 20] or display of seeking behavior [16, 21]. Rats have been recently shown to be prosocial under distress [17, 18] (but see [26–29]); however, what drives prosociality in these animals remains unclear. To address this issue, we developed a two-choice task in which prosocial behavior did not yield a benefit or a cost to the focal rat. We used a double T-maze in which only the focal rat controlled access to the food-baited arms of its own and the recipient rat’s maze. In this task, the focal rat could choose between one side of the maze, which yielded food only to itself (selfish choice), and the opposite side, which yielded food to itself and the recipient rat (prosocial choice). Rats showed a high proportion of prosocial choices. By manipulating reward delivery to the recipient and its ability to display a preference for the baited arm, we found that the display of food-seeking behavior leading to reward was necessary to drive prosocial choices. In addition, we found that there was more social investigation between rats in selfish trials than in prosocial trials, which may have influenced the focals’ choices. This study shows that rats provide access to food to others in the absence of added direct self-benefit, bringing new insights into the factors that drive prosociality.},

  abstract = {In species that form dominance hierarchies, there are often opportunities for low-ranking individuals to challenge high-ranking ones, resulting in a rise or fall in social rank. How does an animal rapidly detect, process, and then respond to these social transitions? This article explores and summarizes how these social transitions can rapidly (within 24 h) impact an individual’s behavior, physiology, and brain, using the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, as a model. Male A. burtoni form hierarchies in which a few brightly-colored dominant males defend territories and spawn with females, while the remaining males are subordinate, more drab-colored, do not hold a territory, and have minimal opportunities for reproduction. These social phenotypes are plastic and reversible, meaning that individual males may switch between dominant and subordinate status multiple times within a lifetime. When the social environment is manipulated to create males that either ascend (subordinate to dominant) or descend (dominant to subordinate) in rank, there are rapid changes in behavior, circulating hormones, and levels of gene expression in the brain that reflect the direction of transition. For example, within minutes, males ascending in status show bright coloration, a distinct eye-bar, increased dominance behaviors, activation of brain nuclei in the social behavior network, and higher levels of sex steroids in the plasma. Ascending males also show rapid changes in levels of neuropeptide and steroid receptors in the brain, as well as in the pituitary and testes. To further examine hormone–behavior relationships in this species during rapid social ascent, the present study also measured levels of testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone, estradiol, progestins, and cortisol in the plasma during the first week of social ascent and tested for correlations with behavior. Plasma levels of all steroids were rapidly increased at 30 min after social ascent, but were not correlated with behavior during the initial rise in rank, suggesting that behavior is dissociated from endocrine status. These changes during social ascent are then compared with our current knowledge about males descending in rank, who rapidly show faded coloration, decreased dominance behaviors, increased subordinate behaviors, and higher circulating levels of cortisol. Collectively, this work highlights how the perception of similar social cues that are opposite in value are rapidly translated into adaptive behavioral and neuroendocrine changes that promote survival and reproductive fitness. Finally, future directions are proposed to better understand the mechanisms that govern these rapid changes in social position.},

Normal force, shear force, and finger extension/flexion all result in different patterns of blood volume beneath the fingernail. This phenomenon has been exploited in order to detect finger forces and finger posture by creating a photoplethysmograph "fingernail sensor," which measures the two-dimensional pattern of blood volume beneath the fingernail. In this paper, a filter is designed to predict the normal force, lateral shear force, longitudinal shear force, and bending angle based on readings from the fingernail sensor. Linear, polynomial, and neural network models relating the bending angle and touch forces to optical sensor outputs are developed and tested. A method is developed to uniformly calibrate the predictor for each user. Calibration experiments are performed to train and validate the predictor for seven human subjects. Results show that on average, shear forces can be predicted with 0.5 N root mean square (rms) error, normal force with 1 N rms error, and posture angle with 10 degrees rms error. Applications and methods for improving performance are discussed.},

  abstract = {Occupational burnout, manifested by emotional exhaustion, lack of a sense of personal achievement, and depersonalization, is not a new phenomenon, but thusfar, there is no clear definition or diagnostic guidelines. The aim of this article wasto summarize all empirical studies to date that have used medical neuroimaging techniques to provide evidence or links regarding changes in brain function in occupational burnout syndrome from a neuroscientific perspective, and then use these to propose a fuzzy-based computational model of burnout.A comprehensive literature search was conducted in two major databases (PubMed and Medline Complete). The search period was 2006–2021, and searches were limited to the English language. Each article was carefully reviewed and appropriately selected on the basis of raw data, validity of methods used, clarity of results, and scales for measuring burnout. The results showed that the brain structures of patients with job burnout that are associated with emotion, motivation, and empathy weresignificantly different from healthy controls. These altered brain regions included the thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, striatum, dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, inferior frontal cingulate cortex, middle frontal cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, and grey matter. Deepening our understanding of how these brain structures are related to burnout will pave the way for better approaches fordiagnosis and intervention. As an alternative to the neuroimaging approach, the paper presents a late proposal of the PLUS (personal living usual satisfaction) parameter. It is based on a fuzzy model, wherein the data source is psychological factors—the same or similar to the neuroimaging approach. As the novel approach to searching for neural burnout mechanisms, we have shown that computational models, including those based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks, can play an important role in inferring and predicting burnout. Effective computational models of burnout are possible but need further development to ensure accuracy across different populations. There is also a need to identify mechanisms and clinical indicators of chronic fatigue syndrome, stress, burnout, and natural cognitive changes associated with, for example, ageing, in order to introduce more effective differential diagnosis and screening.},

  abstract = {Individuals occupying dominant and subordinate positions in social hierarchies exhibit divergent behaviours, physiology and neural functioning. Dominant animals express higher levels of dominance behaviours such as aggression, territorial defence and mate-guarding. Dominants also signal their status via auditory, visual or chemical cues. Moreover, dominant animals typically increase reproductive behaviours and show enhanced spatial and social cognition as well as elevated arousal. These biobehavioural changes increase energetic demands that are met via shifting both energy intake and metabolism and are supported by coordinated changes in physiological systems including the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal and hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axes as well as altered gene expression and sensitivity of neural circuits that regulate these behaviours. Conversely, subordinate animals inhibit dominance and often reproductive behaviours and exhibit physiological changes adapted to socially stressful contexts. Phenotypic changes in both dominant and subordinate individuals may be beneficial in the short-term but lead to long-term challenges to health. Further, rapid changes in social ranks occur as dominant animals socially ascend or descend and are associated with dynamic modulations in the brain and periphery. In this paper, we provide a broad overview of how behavioural and phenotypic changes associated with social dominance and subordination are expressed in neural and physiological plasticity.

Employing novel experimental systems for behavioral analysis of both subjects and stimuli during the social preference test, we reveal marked differences in behavioral dynamics between the strains, suggesting stronger and faster induction of social motivation in SD rats. These different behavioral patterns, which correlate with distinctive c-Fos expression in social motivation-related brain areas, are modified by competition with non-social rewarding stimuli, in a strain-specific manner. Thus, these two strains differ in their social behavior, which should be taken into consideration when selecting an appropriate model organism.},

Since androgens respond to social interactions, increasing in winners and decreasing in losers, we hypothesized that socially induced transient changes in androgen levels could be a causal mediator of winner/loser effects. To test this hypothesis, we staged fights between dyads of size-matched males of the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). After the first contest, winners were treated with the anti-androgen cyproterone acetate and losers were supplemented with 11-ketotestosterone. Two hours after the end of the first fight, two contests were staged simultaneously between the winner of the first fight and a naive male and between the loser of first fight and another naive male. The majority (88\%) of control winners also won the second interaction, whereas the majority of control losers (87\%) lost their second fight, thus confirming the presence of winner/loser effects in this species. As predicted, the success of anti-androgen-treated winners in the second fight decreased significantly to chance levels (44\%), but the success of androgenized losers (19\%) did not show a significant increase. In summary, the treatment with anti-androgen blocks the winner effect, whereas androgen administration fails to reverse the loser effect, suggesting an involvement of androgens on the winner but not on the loser effect.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals who experience emotional, physical, or sexual abuse as children suffer from higher rates of major depressive disorder, drug abuse, and suicide. Early life interventions such as peer support groups can be beneficial to adolescents who experience trauma, suggesting that social support is important in facilitating rehabilitation and promoting resiliency to stress. Although there are some animal paradigms that can model how peer-peer interactions influence stress-reactivity, less is known about how individual stress experiences influence the effectiveness of social buffering. METHODS: The vicarious social defeat stress (VSDS) paradigm allows for the assessment of two different stress modalities, physical (PS) and emotional (ES) stress, which confer different levels of stress with similar biological and behavioral outcomes. Using a modified VSDS paradigm in which pairs of mice experience ES and PS together we can begin to evaluate how stress exposure influences the buffering efficacy of social relationships. Adolescent mice (postnatal day 35) were randomly combined into dyads and were allocated into either mutual experience or cohabitation pairs. Within each dyad, one mouse was assigned to the physically stressed (PS) condition and was repeatedly exposed to an aggressive CD1 mouse while the other mouse was designated as the partner. In the mutual experience dyads the partner mice witnessed the defeat bout (ES) while in the cohabitation dyads the partner was separated from the PS mouse and returned after the 10\>min defeat bout was terminated (non-stressed). After 10 days of defeat, mice were tested in the social interaction test (SIT), the elevated plus maze (EPM), and the forced swim test (FST). RESULTS: PS-exposed mice in the cohabitation dyads, but not those in the mutual experience dyads, showed significantly more avoidance of a novel CD1 aggressor or c57BL/6 mouse, in the SIT. Surprisingly, both partner conditions showed avoidance to a CD1. Interestingly, non-stressed partner mice spent less time in the open arms of the EPM, suggesting increased anxiety; only PS-exposed mice in cohabitation dyads showed more time spent immobile in the FST, indicative of increased learned helplessness. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the efficacy of social buffering can be mediated by individual stress experience.},

  abstract = {One complex task involving sequence of movements and movement refinement in the rat is the single-pellet reaching task, comprising orientation, transport and withdrawal in sequence. In turn, orientation comprises front wall detection, slot localization and nose poke until reach start. Video recordings of a rat in the reaching box highlighted three stages of temporal training: start of training (ST), forepaw dominance appearance (D) and fully trained (T). Regarding orientation, ST versus D and T presented a significant smaller frequency of approach to the front wall and a significant higher number of whisker cycles and nose touches during slot localization, involving a significant longer Orientation. At the ST stage, 44\% of the trials were interrupted after nose poke, and poke took place at significant higher level from the shelf. The shelf was identified only when short whiskers contacted it, but the tongue and both forepaws were used without distinction to reach and grasp the pellet until a forepaw emerged as dominant at D stage. Regarding the temporal features of transport and withdrawal, comparing the D versus T stage revealed a significant longer duration. Finally, successes were significantly higher in T respect to D, meaning that after dominance emergence, more training was still necessary to improve reaching/grasping performance. This study provides evidence that, during training, the rats develop a strategy to obtain the pellets and then refine their movement pattern.},

Three white rats are placed in a cramped beaker and forced to compete for a single food pellet. When they are well-fed, this results in competition but not outright battles. When they are underfed, however, it gets nasty. After a number of fights, they eventually settle into a hierarchy, with the rat whose the biggest bully getting first grabs at the food pellet, the middle rat occasionally offering mild resistance, and the submissive rat becoming so scared he refuses to eat even when alone. The stark, disturbing atmosphere of this film is intensified by the soundtrack, which consists only of film sprocket noises alternating with a trio of repetitive beats----boom boom boom, boom boom boom, over and over again. The uncaring "objectivity" of the film is also disturbing, considering that this was probably a highly stressful experience for the rats. The results of the experiment are interesting, though, showing us how dominance hierarchies are formed. This would be a good film for video artists to mine for footage for a film about violence.

This shortened film tells all we really need to know about what happens when you put three hungry rats with each other and only one pellet of food. One of them is going to be tougher than the other, and will fight to the finish in order to maintain it's dominance. Nothing really surprising here, love the "frozen fight position" they take.    Reviewer: Wilford B. Wolf - 3 out of 5 stars - February 17, 2005  Subject: ..Try to take over the world!    Another in a group of silent psychology/sociology films aimed at college students. This one deals with how hieracrchies of dominance are created. The film is mostly static shots of three rats in a small enclosure, with intertitles explaining the action. The action is a bit dry, but it still is interesting to see how, as the scientists underfeed the rats, a hierarchy is formed and changes in behavior.    However, the obvious point of this, especially in the late 1930s and early 1940s, was an extrapolation of rat behaviors to human psychology. This point is made most clear at the end equating dominance with improved problem solving ability. More recent brain research has called into question how findings of experiments such as depicted in this film actually apply to humans. Still, the film is an interesting study of animal behavior.}

Valproic acid (VPA) was reported to increase the prevalence of ASD in humans as a consequence of its use during pregnancy. VPA treatment also induces autistic-like behaviors in the offspring of rats after prenatal exposure; hence it is a preclinical disease model with high translational value. In the present study, our aim was to characterize ASD relevant behaviors of socially housed, individually identified male rats in automated home cages. The natural behavior of rats was assessed by monitoring their visits to drinking bottles in an environment without human influence aiming at reducing interventional stress. Although rodents normally tend to explore their new environment, prenatally VPA-treated rats showed a drastic impairment in initial and long-term exploratory behavior throughout their stay in the automated cage. Furthermore, VPA rats displayed psychogenic polydipsia (PPD) as well as altered circadian activity. In the competitive situation of strict water deprivation controls switched to an uneven resource sharing and only a few dominant animals had access to water. In VPA animals similar hierarchy-related changes were completely absent. While the control rats secured their chance to drink with frequent reentering visits, thereby “guarding” the water resource, VPA animals did not switch to uneven sharing and displayed no evidence of guarding behavior.},

However, current neuronal interfaces hinder long-term studies in awake and freely behaving animals, as they are limited in their ability to provide simultaneous and prolonged delivery of multiple drugs, are often bulky and lack multifunctionality, and employ custom control systems with insufficiently versatile selectivity for output mode, animal selection and target brain circuits. Here, we describe smartphone-controlled, minimally invasive, soft optofluidic probes with replaceable plug-like drug cartridges for chronic in vivo pharmacology and optogenetics with selective manipulation of brain circuits. We demonstrate the use of the probes for the control of the locomotor activity of mice for over four weeks via programmable wireless drug delivery and photostimulation. Owing to their ability to deliver both drugs and photopharmacology into the brain repeatedly over long time periods, the probes may contribute to uncovering the basis of neuropsychiatric diseases.},

Previously, we established an animal model of elbow PTJC quantifying passive post-mortem joint mechanics and histological changes temporally. These results showed persistent motion loss similar to what is experienced in humans. Functional assessment of PTJC in our model was not previously considered; however, these measures would provide a clinically relevant measure and would further validate our model by demonstrating persistently altered joint function. To this end, a custom bilateral grip strength device was developed, and a recently established open-source gait analysis system was used to quantify forelimb function in our unilateral injury model. In vivo joint function was shown to be altered long-term and never fully recover. Specifically, forelimb strength in the injured limbs showed persistent deficits at all time points; additionally, gait patterns remained imbalanced and asymmetric throughout the study (although a few gait parameters did return to near normal levels). A quantitative understanding of these longitudinal, functional disabilities further strengthens the clinical relevance of our rat PTJC model enabling assessment of the effectiveness of future interventions aimed at reducing or preventing PTJC.},

Recent findings~           Many mental health services remain too hospital-centric, often without adequate outreach services. On the basis of outcome evidence, we need to shift the balance of mental health services from hospital-centered with community outreach when convenient for staff, to community-centered and mobile, with in-reach to hospital only when necessary. Too few training programs emphasize the macroskills of public advocacy, working with service users, families, social movements, and the media to improve mental health and wellbeing of regional and local communities.           Summary~           We should adopt a health ecosystems approach to mental healthcare and training, encompassing nano to macrolevels of service in every region. Catchment mental health services should be rebuilt as community-centric mental health services, integrating all community and inpatient components, but led and integrated from community sites. Community psychiatrists and mental health professionals of the future will need to be well trained in the nano to macroskills required to take responsibility for the mental health and wellbeing of their catchment communities and to provide leadership in service-planning, management, and continuing revision on the basis of rigorous evaluation. These approaches should be the core of all training in psychiatry and all mental health professions prior to any subspecialization.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dominance hierarchies of social animal groups are very sensitive to stress. Stress experienced prior to social interactions between conspecifics may be a determinant of their future social dynamics. Additionally, long-term occupancy of a specific hierarchical rank can have psychophysiological effects which increase vulnerability to future stressors. METHODS: We aimed to delineate differential effects of stress acting before or after hierarchy formation. We studied whether exposure to the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm before a two-week-long hierarchy formation affected the attainment of a dominant status using the social confrontation tube test (TT). These animals were singly housed for at least one week before CSDS to decrease confounding effects of prior hierarchy experience. Additionally, we investigated whether social rank predicted vulnerability to CSDS, measured by a social interaction test. RESULTS: In TT, mice termed as dominant (high rank) win the majority of social confrontations, while the subordinates (low rank) lose more often. Within newly established hierarchies of stress-naïve mice, the subordinate, but not dominant, mice exhibited significantly greater avoidance of novel social targets. However, following exposure to CSDS, both lowest- and highest-ranked mice exhibited susceptibility to stress as measured by decreased interactions with a novel social target. In contrast, after CSDS, both stress-susceptible (socially avoidant) and stress-resilient (social) mice were able to attain dominant ranks in newly established hierarchies. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the response to CSDS did not determine social rank in new cohorts, but low-status mice in newly established groups exhibited lower sociability to novel social targets. Interestingly, exposure of a hierarchical social group to chronic social stress led to stress susceptibility in both high- and low-status mice as measured by social interaction.},

  abstract = {Empathy is critical to successful mental health support. Empathy measurement has predominantly occurred in synchronous, face-to-face settings, and may not translate to asynchronous, text-based contexts. Because millions of people use text-based platforms for mental health support, understanding empathy in these contexts is crucial. In this work, we present a computational approach to understanding how empathy is expressed in online mental health platforms. We develop a novel unifying theoretically-grounded framework for characterizing the communication of empathy in text-based conversations. We collect and share a corpus of 10k (post, response) pairs annotated using this empathy framework with supporting evidence for annotations (rationales). We develop a multi-task RoBERTa-based bi-encoder model for identifying empathy in conversations and extracting rationales underlying its predictions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively identify empathic conversations. We further apply this model to analyze 235k mental health interactions and show that users do not self-learn empathy over time, revealing opportunities for empathy training and feedback.},

  abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling systems that augment and collaborate with humans to perform simple, mechanistic tasks such as scheduling meetings and grammar-checking text. However, such human–AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to the difficulties that AI systems face in navigating complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop HAILEY, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate HAILEY in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife (N\,=\,300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our human–AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.6\% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger, 38.9\% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyse the human–AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social and high-stakes tasks such as empathic conversations.},

The rat species, with more active behavioral characteristics, is more susceptible to being adjusted by the robot. The increased time spent by the outside observers in the vicinity of the robot indicates that a biomimetic robot has the promise for modulating rat behavior even without direct interaction.

Additionally, a virtual impedance model-based control method is used to generate both posture and trajectory for WR-5. The results of simulations and following tests with real rats show that WR-5 can adjust its head and body positioning to follow a target rat in real time. The control system simultaneously allows real-time avoidance of moving outside observers during the following test.

Whether suppressing myostatin could benefit pressure-overloaded heart remains unclear. We investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of myostatin on cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in a mouse model of pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Two weeks after the surgery, TAC and sham mice were randomly divided into groups receiving mRK35, a monoclonal anti-myostatin antibody, or vehicle (PBS) for 8 wk. Significant progressive cardiac hypertrophy was observed in TAC mice, as reflected by the increased wall thickness, ventricular weight, and cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes. In the groups treated with mRK35, compared with sham mice, cardiac fibrosis was increased in TAC mice, accompanied with elevated mRNA expression of fibrotic genes. However, among the TAC mice, mRK35 did not reduce cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis. Body weight, lean mass, and wet weights of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle bundle were increased by mRK35. When compared with the TAC-PBS group, the TAC mice treated with mRK35 demonstrated greater forelimb grip strength and a larger mean size of gastrocnemius fibers. Our data suggest that mRK35 does not attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in a TAC mouse model but has positive effects on muscle mass and muscle strength. Anti-myostatin treatment may have therapeutic value against muscle wasting in cardiac vascular disease.},

The activity level of each rat subject is evaluated by scoring its locomotor activity and frequencies of performing rearing (rising up on its hind limbs) and body grooming (body cuddling and head curling) actions, whereas the degree of preference of that is indicated by the robot–rat distance and the frequency of contacting WR-4. The moving speed and behaviour of WR-4 are controlled in real-time based on the feedback from rat motion. The activity level and degree of preference of rats for each experimental condition are analysed and compared to understand the influence of robot behaviour.

However, because we do not have a lightweight, wireless recording system that is free of interference, it is still unclear how the neural activity of the mPFC region is involved in the diverse, interacting behaviors that comprise competition. Herein, we present an interference-free, lightweight, wireless neural probe system that we applied to two mice to measure mPFC neural activities during a food competition test. In the test, we categorized 18 behavioral repertoires expressed by the mice. From the analysis of the neural signals during each repetition of the test, we found that the mPFC neural activity had the most positive correlation with goal-driven competitive behaviors, such as guarding resources and behaviors related to the extortion of resources. Remarkably, we found that the neural activity associated with guarding behavior was higher than that of extorting behavior, and this highlighted the importance of resource-guarding behavior for winning the competition, i.e., ‘winning a trophy is hard, but keeping it is harder’. Our approach in which a wireless system is used will enable in-depth studies of the brains of mice in their natural social interactions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Evolutionary studies of cooperation in traditional human societies suggest that helping family and responding in kind when helped are the primary mechanisms for informally distributing resources vital to day-to-day survival (e.g., food, knowledge, money, childcare). However, these studies generally rely on forms of regression analysis that disregard complex interdependences between aid, resulting in the implicit assumption that kinship and reciprocity drive the emergence of entire networks of supportive social bonds. Here I evaluate this assumption using individual-oriented simulations of network formation (i.e., Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models). Specifically, I test standard predictions of cooperation derived from the evolutionary theories of kin selection and reciprocal altruism alongside well-established sociological predictions around the self-organisation of asymmetric relationships. Simulations are calibrated to exceptional public data on genetic relatedness and the provision of tangible aid amongst all 108 adult residents of a village of indigenous horticulturalists in Nicaragua (11,556 ordered dyads). Results indicate that relatedness and reciprocity are markedly less important to whom one helps compared to the supra-dyadic arrangement of the tangible aid network itself.},

  abstract = {Understanding and promoting subjective wellbeing (SWB) has been the topic of increasing research, due in part to its potential contributions to health and productivity. To date, the conceptualization of SWB has been grounded within social psychology and largely focused on self-report measures. In this paper, we explore the potentially complementary tools and theoretical perspectives offered by computational neuroscience, with a focus on the active inference (AI) framework. This framework is motivated by the fact that the brain does not have direct access to the world; to select actions, it must instead infer the most likely external causes of the sensory input it receives from both the body and the external world. Because sensory input is always consistent with multiple interpretations, the brain’s internal model must use background knowledge, in the form of prior expectations, to make a “best guess” about the situation it is in and how it will change by taking one action or another. This best guess arises by minimizing an error signal representing the deviation between predicted and observed sensations given a chosen action—quantified mathematically by a variable called free energy (FE). Crucially, recent proposals have illustrated how emotional experience may emerge within AI as a natural consequence of the brain keeping track of the success of its model in selecting actions to minimize FE. In this paper, we draw on the concepts and mathematics in AI to highlight how different computational strategies can be used to minimize FE—some more successfully than others. This affords a characterization of how diverse individuals may adopt unique strategies for achieving high SWB. It also highlights novel ways in which SWB could be effectively improved. These considerations lead us to propose a novel computational framework for understanding SWB. We highlight several parameters in these models that could explain individual and cultural differences in SWB, and how they might inspire novel interventions. We conclude by proposing a line of future empirical research based on computational modelling that could complement current approaches to the study of wellbeing and its improvement.},

  abstract = {The extent of (in)equality is highly diverse across species of social mammals, but we have a poor understanding of the factors that produce or inhibit equitable social organizations. Here, we adopt a comparative evolutionary perspective to test whether the evolution of social dominance hierarchies, a measure of social inequality in animals, exhibits phylogenetic conservatism and whether interspecific variation in these traits can be explained by sex, age or captivity. We find that hierarchy steepness and directional consistency evolve rapidly without any apparent constraint from evolutionary history. Given this extraordinary variability, we next consider multiple factors that have evolved to mitigate social inequality. Social networks, coalitionary support and knowledge transfer advantage to privilege some individuals over others. Nutritional access and prenatal stressors can impact the development of offspring, generating health disparities with intergenerational consequences. Intergenerational transfer of material resources (e.g. stone tools, food stashes, territories) advantage those who receive. Nonetheless, many of the same social species that experience unequal access to food (survival) and mates (reproduction) engage in levelling mechanisms such as food sharing, adoption, revolutionary coalitions, forgiveness and inequity aversion. Taken together, mammals rely upon a suite of mechanisms of (in)equality to balance the costs and benefits of group living.

Naringenin, a flavonoid found in citrus fruits, improves insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation and tumor growth in preclinical models. Therefore, the study hypothesizes that dietary supplementation of naringenin will improve insulin sensitivity, decrease inflammation, slow body weight loss, and delay tumor growth in a mouse model of cancer cachexia. Methods and Results Mice are fed 2 wt\% dietary naringenin before and during initiation of cancer cachexia using inoculated adenocarcinoma-26 cells (C-26). Food intake, body weight, body composition, muscle function, insulin tolerance, and inflammatory status are assessed. Although naringenin-fed tumor-bearing mice exhibit reductions in body weight and food intake earlier than control diet-fed tumor-bearing mice, dietary naringenin is protective against loss of muscle strength, and attenuates the onset of insulin resistance and markers of inflammation. Conclusions Dietary supplementation of naringenin improves multiple aspects of metabolic disturbance and inflammation during cancer cachexia progression in [C-26 tumor-bearing] mice. However, the acceleration of anorexia and weight loss is also observed. These findings emphasize the link between inflammation and insulin resistance as a basis for understanding their roles in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia.},

  abstract = {Modelling complex social behavior in the laboratory is challenging and requires analyses of dyadic interactions occurring over time in a physically and socially complex environment. In the current study, we approached the analyses of complex social interactions in group-housed male CD1 mice living in a large vivarium. Intensive observations of social interactions during a 3-week period indicated that male mice form a highly linear and steep dominance hierarchy that is maintained by fighting and chasing behaviors. Individual animals were classified as dominant, sub-dominant or subordinate according to their David’s Scores and I\& SI ranking. Using a novel dynamic temporal Glicko rating method, we ascertained that the dominance hierarchy was stable across time. Using social network analyses, we characterized the behavior of individuals within 66 unique relationships in the social group. We identified two individual network metrics, Kleinberg’s Hub Centrality and Bonacich’s Power Centrality, as accurate predictors of individual dominance and power. Comparing across behaviors, we establish that agonistic, grooming and sniffing social networks possess their own distinctive characteristics in terms of density, average path length, reciprocity out-degree centralization and out-closeness centralization. Though grooming ties between individuals were largely independent of other social networks, sniffing relationships were highly predictive of the directionality of agonistic relationships. Individual variation in dominance status was associated with brain gene expression, with more dominant individuals having higher levels of corticotropin releasing factor mRNA in the medial and central nuclei of the amygdala and the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, as well as higher levels of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA. This study demonstrates the potential and significance of combining complex social housing and intensive behavioral characterization of group-living animals with the utilization of novel statistical methods to further our understanding of the neurobiological basis of social behavior at the individual, relationship and group levels.},

  abstract = {Social stress is prevalent in many facets of modern society. Epidemiological data suggest that stress is linked to the development of overweight, obesity and metabolic disease. Although there are strong associations between the incidence of obesity with stress and elevated levels of hormones such as cortisol, there are limited animal models to allow investigation of the etiology of increased adiposity resulting from exposure to stress. Perhaps more importantly, an animal model that mirrors the consequences of stress in humans will provide a vehicle to develop rational clinical therapy to treat or prevent adverse outcomes from exposure to chronic social stress. In the visible burrow system (VBS) model of chronic social stress mixed gender colonies are housed for 2~week periods during which male rats of the colony quickly develop a dominance hierarchy. We found that social stress has significant effects on body weight and body composition such that subordinate rats progressively develop characteristics of obesity that occurs, in part, through neuroendocrine alterations and changes in food intake amount. Although subordinate rats are hyperphagic following social stress they do not increase their intake of sucrose solution as control and dominants do suggesting that they are anhedonic. Consumption of a high fat diet does not appear to affect development of a social hierarchy and appears to enhance the effect that chronic stress has on body composition. The visible burrow system (VBS) model of social stress may be a potential laboratory model for studying stress-associated metabolic disease, including the metabolic syndrome.},

Methods: Female wild-type (WT) and OI (Col1a1Jrt/+) mice either performed voluntarily wheel-running exercise for 7-weeks or remained sedentary. Running distance and speed, forelimb grip strength, isolated muscle force and fatigability as well as bone morphology and mechanical properties were assessed. Results: We demonstrate that female WT and OI mice voluntarily performed exercise, although OI mice exercised less than WT littermates. The exercise regimen increased soleus muscle masses in WT and OI but increased relative grip strength in WT mice only. Specific muscle force and fatigability were similar between WT and OI mice and did not improve with exercise. Furthermore, the exercise regimen did not improve the femoral architectural and biomechanical properties in OI mice. Conclusion: Our study suggests that voluntary wheel running is not appropriate to assess the effects of exercise in a mouse model of OI. Findings from exercising OI mice model studies may not necessarily be transferable to humans.},

In our model, a social hierarchy established by two male rats during a first encounter is not maintained 1 week later. If one of the two rats is stressed, the stressed rat becomes subordinate and the hierarchy that is formed is maintained. In this study, we investigated the changes in the expression of oxytocin (Otr) and vasopressin (V1aR) receptor genes in the medial amygdala (MeA) and the lateral septum (LS) in the hours following hierarchy establishment under both stressed and basal conditions. We found that the potentiation of a social hierarchy induced by stress is accompanied by social status- and region-specific changes in the expression of Otr mRNA in the MeA 3\,h after the social encounter. At this time point, no evidence was found for the regulation of V1aR mRNA in any of the brain regions examined. Results from pharmacological experiments involving the microinfusion of a specific OTR antagonist immediately after the acquisition of a subordinate status under basal, non-stress conditions suggested a role for this receptor in the MeA on the long-term establishment of the subordinate status. Altogether, these findings highlight a role for the oxytocinergic system in the mechanisms through which stress facilitates the long-term establishment of a social hierarchy.},

In the present study, we investigated the role of increasing corticosterone levels before or just after a first social encounter between two rats of a dyad in the establishment and the long-term maintenance of a social hierarchy. We show that pre-social encounter corticosterone treatment does not affect the outcome of the hierarchy during a first encounter, but induces a long-term memory for the hierarchy when the corticosterone-injected rat becomes dominant during the encounter, but not when it becomes subordinate. Post-social encounter corticosterone leads to a long-term maintenance of the hierarchy only when the subordinate rat of the dyad is injected with corticosterone. This corticosterone effect mimics previously reported actions of stress on the same model and, hence, implicates glucocorticoids in the consolidation of the memory for a recently established hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Background Peripheral nerves can regenerate and restore function after injury but this process is hindered by many factors including chronic denervation, motor end-plate resorption and Schwann cell senescence. Forelimb injury models in rodents are becoming increasingly popular as they more accurately reflect the physiology and biomechanics of upper extremity nerve injuries. However several aspects of this surgical model remain poorly characterized. New Method C57Bl/6 mice underwent enumeration of median nerve motor and sensory neuron pools using retrograde labeling with or without nerve transection. Distal histomorphometry of uninjured mouse median nerves was also examined. Baseline reference values of volitional forelimb grip strength measurements were determined and the rate of neural elongation was also estimated. Results We identified 1363 ± 165 sensory and 216 ± 16 motor neurons within the uninjured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and ventral spinal cord, respectively. Eight days following injury, approximately 34\% of motoneurons had elongated a distance of 5mm beyond the repair site 8 days following injury. Volitional grip strength decreased 50\% with unilateral median nerve transection and was negligible with contralateral flexor tendon tenotomy. Comparison with existing method Our spinal cord and DRG harvesting technique presented here was technically straightforward and reliable. Estimates of motor and sensory neuron numbers for the mouse median nerve compared favourably with studies using intramuscular injection of retrograde neurotracer. Histomorphometry data was consistent with and reinforced reference values in the literature. Conclusions This study provides data that further develops an increasingly popular surgical model for studying peripheral nerve injury and repair.},

The main odor component of rose oil is 2-phenylethanol (2-PE), but the neuropsychological effects of 2-PE have not been investigated in detail. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of 2-PE on mouse behavior. We first investigated whether 2-PE is attractive or repulsive to mice. After 2-PE inhalation, the mice underwent a series of behavioral experiments, such as the elevated plus maze, open field, Y-maze, tail-suspension, and Porsolt forced-swim tests. Mice did not have a strong interest in 2-PE but were not repelled by it nor were fearful. In the open field test, mice that had inhaled 2-PE spent less time in the center area, while in the tail suspension test, their immobility time decreased. There was no change in cognitive function, activity level, muscle strength, or aggression in these mice. Our results suggest that 2-PE elicits neuropsychological effects that alter the behavior of mice and may also elicit anti-depressive effects. Inhalation of rose oil containing 2-PE may be effective against depression and stress-related diseases.},

During behavioural experiments, mice frequently experience human contact. However, the effects of repeated handling on mice behaviour remains unclear. To minimise mice stress, methods of moving mice using transparent tunnels or cups have been recommended but are impractical in behavioural tests. To investigate these effects, we used a behavioural test battery to assess differences between mice accustomed to the experimenter’s handling versus control mice. Repeatedly handled mice gained slightly more weight than control mice. In behavioural tests, repeatedly handled mice showed improved spatial cognition in the Y-maze test and reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze test. However, there was no change in anxiety-like behaviour in the light/dark transition test or open-field test. Grip strength, rotarod, sociability, tail suspension, Porsolt forced swim, and passive avoidance tests revealed no significant differences between repeatedly handled and control mice. Our findings demonstrated that mice repeatedly handled by the experimenter before behavioural tests showed reduced anxiety about high altitudes and improved spatial cognition, suggesting that repeated contact can affect the results of some behavioural tests.},

  abstract = {How dynamic activity in neural circuits gives rise to behavior is a major area of interest in neuroscience. A key experimental approach for addressing this question involves measuring extracellular neuronal activity in awake, behaving animals. Recently developed Neuropixels probes have provided a step change in recording neural activity in large tissue volumes with high spatiotemporal resolution. This protocol describes the chronic implantation of Neuropixels probes in mice and rats using compact and reusable 3D-printed fixtures.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Over the past 60 years, evidence has accumulated on the fundamental role of supportive social relationships in individual health and longevity. This paper first summarizes the results of 23 meta-analyses published between 1994 and 2021, which include 1,187 longitudinal and cross-sectional studies with more than 1,458 million participants. The effect sizes reported in these meta-analyses are highly consistent with regard to the predicted link between social support and reduced disease and mortality; the meta-analyses also highlight various theoretical and methodological issues concerning the multi-dimensionality of the social support concept and its measurements, and the need to control potential confounding and moderator variables. This is followed by an analysis of the experimental evidence from laboratory studies on psychobiological mechanisms that may explain the effect of social support on health and longevity. The stress-buffering hypothesis is examined and extended to incorporate recent findings on the inhibitory effect of social support figures (e.g., the face of loved ones) on fear learning and defensive reactions alongside evidence on the effect of social support on brain networks that down-regulate the autonomic nervous system, HPA axis, and immune system. Finally, the paper discusses the findings in the context of three emerging research areas that are helping to advance and consolidate the relevance of social factors for human health and longevity: (a) convergent evidence on the effects of social support and adversity in other social mammals, (b) longitudinal studies on the impact of social support and adversity across each stage of the human lifespan, and (c) studies that extend the social support framework from individual to community and societal levels, drawing implications for large-scale intervention policies to promote the culture of social support.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Dominance hierarchies emerge when individuals must compete for access to resources such as food, territory or mates. Here, using traditional and network social hierarchy analysis, we show that 10 groups of 12 male laboratory CD1 mice living in large vivaria consistently form extremely linear dominance hierarchies. Within each hierarchy we determine that every individual mouse has a unique social rank and behaves with a high degree of consistency in their agonistic behaviour towards other individuals. Using temporal pairwise comparison Glicko ratings and social network triangle transitivity measures, we demonstrate that these hierarchies emerge rapidly, and that initial aggression is not predictive of later dominance. We also show that groups vary in how unequally power is distributed over time as social networks stabilize. Our results demonstrate that an ethologically relevant housing paradigm coupled with extensive behavioural observations provides a strong framework for investigating the temporal patterning of mouse dominance hierarchies and complex social dynamics. Furthermore, the statistical methods described establish a strong basis for the study of temporal dynamics of social hierarchies across species.},

This paper reviews the existing problems and discusses the latest development of electrode materials for BMI, including conducting polymers, silicon, carbon nanowires, graphene, and hybrid organic–inorganic nanomaterials. In addition, we will inspect at the technical and scientific challenges in the development of neural electrode for a broad application of BMI with focus on the biocompatibility, mechanical mismatch, and electrical performance of electrode materials.},

In this article, we aim to explain how reciprocal social support forms by testing and integrating the social science hypotheses into the modeling of the outside social networks. A series of simulation experiments have been conducted to test our hypotheses and the proposed models. The results show that our proposed models can well capture the reciprocal properties observed in real-world social networks, and our hypotheses can collectively explain the formation of reciprocal social support. By hypothesizing user behaviors of support exchange and modeling the outside social networks, our study advances the understanding of how users participate in online groups, either to give more or to receive more support.},

  abstract = {The application of a neural stimulator to small animals is highly desired for the investigation of electrophysiological studies and development of neuroprosthetic devices. For this purpose, it is essential for the device to be implemented with the capabilities of full implantation and wireless control. Here, we present a fully implantable stimulator with remote controllability, compact size, and minimal power consumption. Our stimulator consists of modular units of (1) a surface-type cortical array for inducing directional change of a rat, (2) a depth-type array for providing rewards, and (3) a package for accommodating the stimulating electronics, a battery and ZigBee telemetry, all of which are assembled after independent fabrication and implantation using customized flat cables and connectors. All three modules were packaged using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) to avoid any chemical reaction after implantation. After bench-top evaluation of device functionality, the stimulator was implanted into rats to train the animals to turn to the left (or right) following a directional cue applied to the barrel cortex. Functionality of the device was also demonstrated in a three-dimensional (3D) maze structure, by guiding the rats to better navigate in the maze. The movement of the rat could be wirelessly controlled by a combination of artificial sensation evoked by the surface electrode array and reward stimulation. We could induce rats to turn left or right in free space and help their navigation through the maze. The polymeric packaging and modular design could encapsulate the devices with strict size limitations, which made it possible to fully implant the device into rats. Power consumption was minimized by a dual-mode power-saving scheme with duty cycling. The present study demonstrated feasibility of the proposed neural stimulator to be applied to neuroprosthesis research.},

  abstract = {Social hierarchy governs the physiological and biochemical behaviors of animals. Intestinal radiation injuries are common complications connected with radiotherapy. However, it remains unclear whether social hierarchy impacts the development of radiation-induced intestinal toxicity. Dominant mice exhibited more serious intestinal toxicity following total abdominal irradiation compared with their subordinate counterparts, as judged by higher inflammatory status and lower epithelial integrity. Radiation-elicited changes in gut microbiota varied between dominant and subordinate mice, being more overt in mice of higher status. Deletion of gut microbes by using an antibiotic cocktail or restructuring of the gut microecology of dominant mice by using fecal microbiome from their subordinate companions erased the difference in radiogenic intestinal injuries. Lactobacillus murinus and Akkermansia~muciniphila were both found to be potential probiotics for use against radiation toxicity in mouse models without social hierarchy. However, only Akkermansia muciniphila showed stable colonization in the digestive tracts of dominant mice, and significantly mitigated their intestinal radiation injuries. Our findings demonstrate that social hierarchy impacts the development of radiation-induced intestinal injuries, in a manner dependent on gut microbiota. The results also suggest that the gut microhabitats of hosts determine the colonization and efficacy of foreign probiotics. Thus, screening suitable microbial preparations based on the gut microecology of patients might be necessary in clinical application.},

  abstract = {Dominance hierarchy profoundly impacts social animals' survival, physical and mental health and reproductive success. As the measurements of dominance hierarchy in rodents become established, it is now possible to understand the neural mechanism mediating the intrinsic and extrinsic factors determining social hierarchy. This review summarizes the latest advances in assay development for measuring dominance hierarchy in laboratory mice. It also reviews our current understandings on how activity and plasticity of specific neural circuits shape the dominance trait and mediate the 'winner effect'.},
